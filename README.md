Summary:

It is well known that interneurons are heterogeneous in their morphologies, biophysical 
properties, pharmacological sensitivities and electrophysiological responses, but it is 
unknown how best to understand this diversity. Given their critical roles in shaping brain 
output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational 
characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it 
has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on 
oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-LM) interneurons in hippocampus CA1 and that the same cells 
contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. 
We create multi-compartment models of an O-LM hippocampal interneuron using passive 
properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and 
explore its signaling characteristics. We find that spike initiation depends on both 
location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal
 synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could 
produce both forward and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We 
speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a 
specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct 
and indirect signaling pathways within the hippocampus.
